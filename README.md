| Sales Data Analysis Project |

This repository contains my deep-dive analysis of a comprehensive sales dataset using Python and Tableau. The dataset includes 10,000 records, and I've explored it from multiple perspectives to identify key patterns and insights.


| Analysis |

The analysis was conducted using Python, specifically the Pandas library. I examined the data from various angles, including:
Temporal trends
Customer behavior
Product performance
Regional variances
Impacts of different shipping modes

| Key Findings |

The analysis revealed several valuable insights that could guide business strategy and decision-making:
Sales increase by 109% during holiday months.
Identification of highest-value customers and top-performing products.
These insights could lead to optimized sales tactics, improved customer engagement, and potentially increase profitability by 20%.

| Data Visualization |

To communicate these findings effectively, I used Python libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn) and Tableau to create interactive and compelling data visualizations. These visualizations offer stakeholders an intuitive understanding of sales performance, customer behavior, and profitability.

Feel free to explore the code and visualizations, and reach out if you have any questions or feedback.
